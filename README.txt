The purpose of this project is to create a whatsapp clone.

My reasoning:
```
- Become familiar with webRTC by using and implementing socket.io
- Gain knowledge in using a SQL database alongside real-time database
- Become more familiar with TypeScript
- Reinforce my React, SQL, and Jest knowledge
- Introduction to Cypress end-end testing as I have not yet experienced front-end testing
```

Admittedly this project will be made by following an online tutorial, but we all need to start somewhere. In the future I will look to create my own projects based around my own ideas!

More details to come...
